## Acknowledgements(Original):-
  This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ And uploaded here, so          anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the dataset from NIH website is quite slow.
